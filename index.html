If I controlled Rewind I would want
<br>
<br>
Fortnite and Marques Brownlee.
<br>
<br>
Is this what you wanted?
<br>
<br>
You know who I would have asked for?
<br>
<br>
Quit horsing around.
<br>
<br>
Play me some of that jumping music.
<br>
<br>
Did you say jumping music?
<br>
<br>
Jumping music?
<br>
<br>
Everybody! Off!
<br>
<br>
Not even a thank you?!
<br>
<br>
Is that Marques?
<br>
<br>
I want Liza!
<br>
<br>
Yeaaaaaahhhh!!!!
<br>
<br>
So guys, apparently we control Rewind this year.
<br>
<br>
Y'all we can do whatever we want. What do we do?
<br>
<br>
There's one thing this video needs.
<br>
<br>
K-pop!
<br>
<br>
Can I have a Royal Wedding?
<br>
<br>
Yeah, but you're marrying Bongo Cat.
<br>
<br>
Wait, what?
<br>
<br>
Rewind needs more science.
<br>
<br>
Can we do an experiment?
<br>
<br>
I love that. Melting lipstick.
<br>
<br>
I want to eat something.
<br>
<br>
Mukbang!
<br>
<br>
Yes, let's do it in Korea!
<br>
<br>
Gallop, what do you want?
<br>
<br>
Marshmello needs to be in this video.
<br>
<br>
Who is Marshmello?
<br>
<br>
How about yodeling kid?
<br>
<br>
With Adam Rippon!
<br>
<br>
Guys, let's do the In My Feelings challenge.
<br>
<br>
Right!
<br>
<br>
I love this song!
<br>
<br>
Let's hear the remix!
<br>
<br>
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.
<br>
<br>
You know who really needs to be in this Rewind video?
<br>
<br>
Everyone who managed to do something bigger than themselves this year.
<br>
<br>
Found a way to help the causes that matter to them most.
<br>
<br>
To everyone who proved it's ok to talk about mental health this year.
<br>
<br>
Showing our viewers that it's ok to go through tough times like that.
<br>
<br>
It takes a lot of bravery to be that vulnerable and I'm so proud of this community.
<br>
<br>
I think this year's Rewind should celebrate the fierce, fabulous
and empowering art of drag.
<br>
<br>
I want to see all of you be your own kind of beautiful.
<br>
<br>
And to those people who have raised money in the field of education.
<br>
<br>
Can we also give a moment to Asian representation in entertainment this year?
<br>
<br>
Major strides were made.
<br>
<br>
And to the people who put aside their differences.
<br>
<br>
Yeah, and created something really special.
<br>
<br>
Here's to all women in 2018 for finding their voices.
<br>
<br>
It's nice seeing how women grew and were empowered.
<br>
<br>
Can we give a moment to working moms? Let's do it!
<br>
<br>
To everyone who taught, or learned, something new this year.
<br>
<br>
And to all the refugees and anyone looking for a home.
<br>
<br>
All of us should send a toast to the kids who follow their dreams.
<br>
<br>
I want to thank the whole community that always supports during our best and worst.
<br>
<br>
We are a family, we are a team.
<br>
<br>
Family is everything.
<br>
<br>
I want to give a moment to everyone who supported me when I got sick.
<br>
<br>
All of the comments and messages I got made me feel like I wasn't alone.
<br>
<br>
We're forgetting something.
<br>
<br>
I think we should read the comments.
<br>
<br>
Yeah I have a feeling this is going to get a little bit crazy.
<br>
<br>
Let's give the people what they want.
<br>
<br>
Aaaahhh
<br>
<br>
That's hot, that's hot.
